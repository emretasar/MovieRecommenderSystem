        <h3>Emre Taşar</h3>
        <p>My name is Emre Taşar, and I completed my primary and secondary education in Sivas. In 2018, I began studying computer engineering at Istanbul Technical University, where I focused on computer vision, image processing, machine learning, and data science. During my university years, I had valuable experiences, including a compulsory internship at TÜBİTAK BİLGEM, where I worked on real-time stress analysis from human face videos. Subsequently, I continued as a scholarship student in the same unit, where I gained familiarity in training and integrating deep learning models for face detection, age-gender detection, face recognition, and emotion analysis. I later completed another compulsory internship at TÜBİTAK BİLGEM, where I contributed to the development of object detection algorithms for autonomous sea vehicles. In my fourth year, I worked as a scholarship student in the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at the ITU Aviation Research Center, conducting research on aircraft clustering algorithms through flight radar data and vehicle type classification (military, civil, or commercial) based on data analysis. Currently, I am doing an internship in the software development unit at Türksat and eagerly looking forward to completing my undergraduate education soon.</p>
